My blog runs on wordpress, and I\u0026rsquo;ve felt for a while that the process of logging in, creating a post, fixing formatting in a WSYWGI editor and eventually posting was too much resistance when I commonly just write notes in plain text. So, why not just write posts in plain text and have something else do the work of turning that in to a post?\nIn comes Hugo, a static site generator written in Go.\nFirst off, I used Chocolatey to install Hugo:\nchoco install hugo I liked the look of the PaperMod theme, simple yet effective. I initially installed using Method 1 - cloning the PaperMod theme directly in to my own code. This caused a bit of faff with git however so I scrapped that and installed via Method 2 - pulling PaperMod in as a submodule.\ngit submodule add --depth=1 https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod.git themes/PaperMod git submodule update --init --recursive # needed when you reclone your repo (submodules may not get cloned automatically) I spent a bit of time tinkering with the config and a test Lipsum post (which I then updated to this post).\nI\u0026rsquo;m not yet ready to scrap my existing Wordpress install, I want to get more familiar with the workings of Hugo first, integrate comments, search etc. So I decided to host Hugo off of Github Pages as an intermediary step. Github Pages doesn\u0026rsquo;t support Hugo out of the box though. However, Github Pages does support just serving raw static HTML/CSS/JS so if we create a separate repository and import this as a submodule in the /public/ folder that Hugo uses to publish, we should be able to publish the generated static site directly in to the GitHub Pages repository\nIt\u0026rsquo;s worth noting you cannot clone an empty repository - you must commit something to the repo before cloning it. I committed a quick readme.md.\ngit submodule add -b main https://github.com/Aidenwebb/aidenwebb.github.io.git public After generating the site with hugo -t PaperMod: Navigate to your public directory and run:\ncd public git add . git commit -m \u0026#34;init commit\u0026#34; git push origin main and the submodule remote repo will be updated, and built by Github Pages.\nWhen hosting on Github pages, something breaks the integrity of CSS files, so I\u0026rsquo;ve opted to disable fingerprinting (config.yml:params:assets:disablefingerprinting:true) for the time being with the intention of investigating further another time.\n","permalink":"https://aidenwebb.github.io/getting-started-with-hugo/","summary":"I recently came to the conclusion that I wasn\u0026rsquo;t posting on my blog nearly as much as I\u0026rsquo;d like to.
