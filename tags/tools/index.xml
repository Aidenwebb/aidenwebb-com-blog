      <description>You know the drill, as the kid with the tech skills you get roped into helping your parents and other family members with their busted tech. I notice that every time I ressurect or reincarnate the treasured device of a family member I end up installing much of the same software. I wrote this to save me some time, and to help others who are in the same boat.
My preferred recommendation in each category is in bold.</description>

      <description>I occurs to me that each time I set up a new system, or re-install my workstation, I often end up hunting down and redownloading tools and software that I use on a regular basis. So I thought I&amp;rsquo;d create a list of useful tools and pop it here on my blog for future reference and to share with others.
I&amp;rsquo;ll try to keep this list updated as I find new tools and software that I find useful.</description>
