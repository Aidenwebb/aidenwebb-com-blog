Hi, I'm Aiden, also known as Logi.

I am a Systems and Infrastructure Architect based in Bournemouth, UK

I'm an avid learner and love a challenge.

I'm an IT Tech with big dreams, a fire performer with big ideas and a tinker with little screwdrivers. I'm many other things too, but we'll get into that as times goes on.

I started this blog as a creative outlet at a time where I most needed to organise my thoughts. Here you'll find helpful tips, introspection and plenty of shenanigans.  
I...  
Work full time at [John Smith and Sons Group][1] as an IT Operations Engineer.  
Freelance as a web designer and manage web hosting at [Rootwire][2].  
And I run a circus and entertainments company, [Steamship Circus][4]!
