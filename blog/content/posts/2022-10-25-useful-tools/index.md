I occurs to me that each time I set up a new system, or re-install my workstation, I often end up hunting down and redownloading tools and software that I use on a regular basis. So I thought I'd create a list of useful tools and pop it here on my blog for future reference and to share with others.

I'll try to keep this list updated as I find new tools and software that I find useful.

If you have any suggestions, please open an Issue or Pull Request on the [Github Repo](https://github.com/Aidenwebb/aidenwebb.github.io/issues)

Bold items are highly recommended and I use them on a daily basis.
